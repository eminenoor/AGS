15 May - 21 May                Detailed design report done, implementation on the way + started / finished implementing the databases 
++ started working on web scraping searching for a suitable weather API with either Java or Python 
22 May - 28 May                SQLite databases mostly done with the implementation, done with the web-scraping with the weather APIs.
Decided on using Java for the weather API as I knew the language better and implementation was easier with the project. 

29 May - 4 June                 Finalized the project for the demo with some of the backend getting additional classes and database implementations. Did most of the work as a group and finalized the project before the demo. 
Corrected very minor aspects of the projects and wrote the final report for the project as well for the final upload.
